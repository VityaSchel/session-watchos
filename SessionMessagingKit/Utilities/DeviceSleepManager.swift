/// This entity has responsibility for blocking the device from sleeping if certain behaviors (e.g. recording or
/// playing voice messages) are in progress.
///
/// Sleep blocking is keyed using "block objects" whose lifetime corresponds to the duration of the block.  For
/// example, sleep blocking during audio playback can be keyed to the audio player.  This provides a measure
/// of robustness.
///
/// On the one hand, we can use weak references to track block objects and stop blocking if the block object is
/// deallocated even if removeBlock() is not called.  On the other hand, we will also get correct behavior to addBlock()
/// being called twice with the same block object.
